Never offline, always within reach, we now wield in our hands a magic wand of technological power we have only begun to grasp. But it raises new enigmas, too. Never more connected, we seem to be growing more distant. Never more efficient, we have never been more distracted.",

I know of no book like this one by Tony Reinke, and I doubt anyone is writing more insightfully on the intersection of where our digital habits clash with our eternal joy. Join me in praying to the living God who gave us technology, to give wings to this important book inside the church and far beyond, a timely gift to all of us riveted by a small screen in search of what is only offered to us in Christ.",
